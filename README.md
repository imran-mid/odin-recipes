Odin Project HTML Foundations project: Recipes

This is part of the Foundations of HTML section of the course.

This website will contain a basic recipe website. This is just to demonstrate basic HTML Knowledge.

I am already familiar with this but want to go through whole project content ðŸ˜ƒ

## Goals

The website will consist of the following:

- a few links to some recipes- 3 recipes for now
- each recipe will be in its own HTML file
- demonstrate use of lists (ordered and unordered), headings, links and images
