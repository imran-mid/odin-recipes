        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes, or other high-quality plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and mushrooms. Sprinkle with
                salt.
                Cook and
                stir until mushrooms release all of their liquid and start to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in bell
                peppers
                and jalapeno
                pepper. Cook and stir until peppers begin to soften up, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, paprika,
                turmeric, black
                pepper, and cayenne. Stir and cook to "wake up" the flavors, about 1 minute. Pour in crushed tomatoes
                and
                water. Adjust
                heat to medium and simmer uncovered until veggies are softened and sweet, stirring occasionally, 15 to
                20
                minutes. Add
                more water if sauce becomes too thick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Make a depression in the sauce for each egg with a large spoon. Crack egg into a small ramekin and slide
                gently into
                each indentation; repeat with the rest of the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until
                eggs
                are to your
                desired doneness.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Top with feta cheese and parsley.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
